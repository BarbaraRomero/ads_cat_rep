# Advertisements in Exhibition Catalogues from the nineteenth century in Spain, the UK and the US

This is a work-in-progress where I collected, extracted and structured information on advertisements contained in exhibition catalogues. This spin-off project tries to squish all the information possible from the exhibition catalogues analysed in my PhD dissertation.
Nineteenth-century exhibition data adds another layer of complexity when working with exhibition data, the historical part, and the availability of sources. The first stage of this research focused on archival work, and the direct data collection took place during the fall of 2019 in the archives of the following institutions: the National Art Library in the Victoria and Albert Museum (London, UK), the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia (Madrid, Spain). The COVID-19 pandemic directly affected in-person work. Hence, I had to rely more on digital resources such as digital libraries (Hathi Trust and Archive.org) or the digital collection of art institutions (Museo del Prado, Museum of Modern Art and The Royal Academy of Arts). 
The exhibition catalogues were available in three formats: 

Fully digitised by the institution. These catalogues were digitised by the holding institutions, which made the data fully available. These catalogues give users access to their information in digital text format. These are easier to consult and analyse as their text is entirely readable by software. 109 catalogues, or 39% of the corpus, are of this type. 

Digitized as images taken by the researcher. The institutions did not digitise these catalogues but were manually captured photographically. An optical character recognition method was applied to the images to extract the textual information to access the data. This corpus contains 68 of these catalogues. i.e., 30% of the corpus. 

Manually transcribed. The remaining 71 catalogues were not available for photographic capture due to copyright restrictions of the library and archive. I extracted the information manually, including any metadata required for classification.
